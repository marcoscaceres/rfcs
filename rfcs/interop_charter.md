# RFC 120: Interop Team Charter

## Summary

An Interop Team is created as part of the web-platform-tests project, defined by a charter [in the team repo](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop/pull/102). The team is tasked with maintaining [Interop 2022](./interop_2022.md), [Interop 2023](./interop_2023.md) and future such efforts.

## Details

The [team charter](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop/pull/102) is made official by this RFC and substantial changes can only be made through the web-platform-tests RFC process.

The Interop Team can define additional public efforts/metrics beyond Interop 2022 and 2023. The process for doing that is decided by the Interop Team, may evolve over time, and is not defined by this RFC.

The Interop team will take ownership of the existing Browser Specific Failures metric, and manage it according to the rules in its charter.

## Risks

This charter is not time limited. Yet, there is no guarantee that there will be enough interest to define a yearly effort/metric, or that participants will be able to find consensus. The outcome would simply be that there will be no new effort/metric announced. In such a case the Interop Team and/or the WPT core team should evaluate whether it's time for an official end to the charter.
