# RFC 120: Interop Team Charter

## Summary

An Interop Team is created as part of the web-platform-tests project, defined by a charter [in the team repo](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop-2022/pull/102). The team is tasked with maintaining [Interop 2022](./interop_2022.md), [Interop 2023](./interop_2023.md) and future such efforts.

## Details

The Interop 2022 [repo](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop-2022) and [team](https://github.com/orgs/web-platform-tests/teams/interop-2022) will be renamed to omit the year, as described in the [Interop 2023 RFC](./interop_2023.md).

The [team charter](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop-2022/pull/102) is made official by this RFC and substantial changes can only be made through the web-platform-tests RFC process.

The Interop Team can define additional public efforts/metrics beyond Interop 2022 and 2023. The process for doing that is decided by the Interop Team, may evolve over time, and is not defined by this RFC.

## Risks

This charter is not time limited. Yet, there is no guarantee that there will be enough interest to define a yearly effort/metric, or that participants will be able to find consensus. The outcome would simply be that there will be no new effort/metric announced. In such a case the Interop Team and/or the WPT core team should evaluate whether it's time for an official end to the charter.
